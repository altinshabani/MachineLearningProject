**Weather Prediction Project**
Predicting the Next Rainy Day
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the next rainy day based on a given Weather History dataset.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Weather History dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle, Weather History link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dataacademyhub/weatherhistory

**Idea**
The main idea of this project is to use past weather data to predict future rainy days. This is a valuable tool for a variety of applications, from agriculture to event planning.

**Methodologies**
The machine learning algorithms used in this project include Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees. The choice of the final algorithm will be made as the project progresses and based on the evaluation of the performance of each algorithm.

**Data Preprocessing**
Data preprocessing is a vital step in this project. It is done using the Python file PjesaPare.py. This script deletes rows with missing values to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the prediction model.
